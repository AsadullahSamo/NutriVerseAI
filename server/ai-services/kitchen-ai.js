IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ONLY suggest recipes that can be made with the EXACT equipment listed above
2. If equipment is missing for a recipe, clearly indicate what's missing
3. Categorize recipes as "canMake" (with current equipment) or "needsEquipment" (missing equipment)
4. Be strict about equipment requirements - don't assume equipment that's not listed

Return EXACTLY this JSON structure with no additional text:
